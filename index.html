    <h1>Venom</h1>
</header>
<div class="primary-content">
    <p>Venom is a web-swinging, crime fighting anti-hero with a heart of gold and a body of alien biomass! Venom has had many enemies, many of which are it's own relatives! Carnage, Toxin, and Anti-Venom are just some of the other symbiotes that Venom has faced off against! Though Venom has had many enemies, it has also had many allies in the form of hosts! Though it has had too many hosts to list here, Venom's favorite host is Eddie Brock. Though not it's first host, Eddie Brock has been with Venom for the longest. Their relationship is almost like a marriage, with Eddie having referred to Venom like a wife, and Venom referring to Eddie in kind.</p>
